# DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE

The Cursor extension is deprecated, as Cursor has implemented hooks for AI edits. Run `git-ai install-hooks` to ensure your environment is setup correctly.

We recommend uninstalling the Cursor extension, if you have already installed, it as the extension may interfere with the new hooks-based Cursor integration.
