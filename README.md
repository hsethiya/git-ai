## Why `git-ai`?

`git blame` attributes all code to the commit's author, even when much of it is AI-generated.

**⭐️Git-native** - enhanced authorship and prompt transcripts are stored in [git notes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes) and linked to commit hashes.

**🫡Simple and explicit** - no file system monitors, keyloggers or batch-write heuristics. Supported Agents call `git-ai` after writing code, using hooks or extensions.

**🤞Emerging Standard** - developers have tool choice, and they're likely using a mix of Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.

**⚡️Fast + Cross Platform** - implemented in Rust, as fast as `git status` and leverages native Git APIs

## Install

To install (or update) `git-ai` run the install script for your platform. The script will automatically setup everything you need, including integrations with coding agents and IDEs.

### Mac, Linux, Windows (WSL)

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acunniffe/git-ai/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Windows (non-WSL)

`git-ai` support for non-WSL Windows is currently experimental. Please file issues if you encounter any issues using `git-ai` on Windows.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acunniffe/git-ai/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Agent Support

`git-ai` automatically sets up all supported agent hooks using the `git-ai install-hooks` command

### How it works

`git-ai` is implemented as a git CLI wrapper. It proxies commands, args, and flags to your `git` binary. You and your IDEs won't notice the difference, but all your code will be annotated with AI Authorship.

Internally, `git-ai` creates checkpoints to establish authorship of specific lines of code. Agents call `git-ai checkpoint` before they write to the file system to mark any previous edits as yours. After they write to the file system, they call `checkpoint agent-name ...` to mark their contributions as AI-generated and to save the associated propmpts. These checkpoints work similarly to how IDEs handle local history and they do not leave your machine. When you commit, `git-ai` compresses and packages the final authorship log and prompt transcripts into a git note attached to the commit.

### Known limitiaitons

- Tab completions (from AI or traditional intellisense) are currently considered human edits.
- Authorship logs will not survive rebase, unless the rebase operation is run without git-ai (for ex, if the rebase is done on GitHub, the authorship logs from the affected commits will be quietly lost).

## Developing `git-ai`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai.git
cd git-ai
cargo build
cargo test
```
