## Why `git-ai`?

`git blame` attributes all code to the commit's author, even when much of it is AI-generated.

**⭐️Git-native** - enhanced authorship and prompt transcripts are stored in [git notes](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-notes) and linked to commit hashes.

**🫡Simple and explicit** - no file system monitors, keyloggers or batch-write heuristics. Supported Agents call `git-ai` after writing code, using hooks or extensions.

**🤞Emerging Standard** - developers have tool choice, and they're likely using a mix of Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, etc.

**⚡️Fast + Cross Platform** - implemented in Rust, as fast as `git status` and leverages native Git APIs

## Install

To install (or update) `git-ai` run the install script for your platform. The script will automatically setup everything you need, including integrations with coding agents and IDEs.

### Mac, Linux, Windows (WSL)

```bash
curl -sSL https://www.gitai.run/install | bash
```

### Windows (non-WSL)

`git-ai` support for non-WSL Windows is currently experimental. Please file issues if you encounter any issues using `git-ai` on Windows.

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Command "irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acunniffe/git-ai/main/install.ps1 | iex"
```

## Agent Support

`git-ai` automatically sets up all supported agent hooks using the `git-ai install-hooks` command

### How it works

`git-ai` is a git CLI wrapper. It proxies commands, args, and flags to your `git` binary. You and your IDEs won't notice the difference, but all your code will be annotated with AI Authorship.

Internally, `git-ai` creates checkpoints to establish authorship of specific lines of code. Agents call `git-ai checkpoint` before they write to the file system to mark any previous edits as yours. After they write to the file system, they call `checkpoint agent-name ...` to mark their contributions as AI-generated and to save the associated propmpts. These checkpoints work similarly to how IDEs handle local history and they do not leave your machine. When you commit, `git-ai` compresses and packages the final authorship log and prompt transcripts into a git note attached to the commit.


### `git-ai` commands

All `git-ai` commands follow this pattern:

```bash
git-ai <command> [options]
```
##### `stats`

Show AI authorship statistics for a commit. Displays how much code was written by humans vs AI.

```bash
# Show stats for current HEAD
git-ai stats

# Show stats for specific commit
git-ai stats <commit-sha>

# Output in JSON format
git-ai stats --json
git-ai stats <commit-sha> --json
```

**Options:**
- `<commit-sha>` - Optional commit SHA (defaults to HEAD)
- `--json` - Output statistics in JSON format

##### `blame`

Enhanced version of `git blame` that shows AI authorship attribution alongside traditional git blame.

```bash
git-ai blame <file>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<file>` - Path to the file to blame (required)

**Options:**
Mostly API Compatible, supports same options as [`git blame`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame). 

##### `install-hooks`

Automatically configure Claude Code, Cursor and GitHub Copilot to send authorship information to the `git-ai` binary 

```bash
git-ai install-hooks
```

### `git` proxy behavior 

After the `git-ai` binary is installed and put on the `$PATH`, it handles all invocations of `git` and `git-ai`. 

`git-ai` aims to be a transparent proxy with an unnoticeable performance impact. We reguarly run builds against [`git`'s unit tests](https://github.com/git/git/tree/master/t) to maximize cross platform compatibility and test the performance of our AI checkpointing code.

There two behavior changes `git-ai` introduces:

1. After commits, `git-ai` adds an AI Authorship log linked to the commit in `notes/ai` and print this visualization for developers: 

![alt](assets/docs/graph.jpg)

2. In Git, notes do not sync by default. `git-ai` will append the refspec for `notes/ai` to `fetch` / `push` calls so they are always synced. 


### Known limitations

- Tab completions (from AI or traditional intellisense) are currently considered human edits.
- Authorship logs will not survive rebase, unless the rebase operation is run without git-ai (for ex, if the rebase is done on GitHub, the authorship logs from the affected commits will be quietly lost).
- AI deletions are not measured, only AI Additions and Total AI Line Count in the repo

## Developing `git-ai`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai.git
cd git-ai
cargo build
cargo test
```

Putting a development build of `git-ai` on your path

```
sh scripts/dev-symlinks.sh
task debug:local 
```
_you'll need to install [taskfile_](https://taskfile.dev/docs/installation)_
