## Supported Git Workflows

### Local

| Git Operation | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Merging branches correctly merges attribution | ✅ |
| Merging branches with `--squash` correctly merges attribution | ✅ |
| `reset --hard` resets attribution to the base commit | ✅ |
| git replace maintains correct attribution | ✅ |
| git worktrees maintains correct attribution | ✅ |
| Amending commits correctly preserves attribution | ✅ |
| After resolving git conflicts, attribution is correct | ✅ |
| Rebase correctly merges attribution | ❌ |
| Cherrypick correctly merges attribution | ❌ |
| reset `--soft` and `--mixed` maintains correct attribution | ❌ |
| `mv` (move or rename files) moves AI attribution to the new file | ❌ |
| Stash / Pop maintain correct attribution | ❌ |

### Server-Side

Because Authorship Logs are linked to commit hashes, server-side operations that create new commits will not have logs attached. You'll have to manually run `git-ai squash-authorship` after the squash or merge operation to update the attribution. 

We'll be publishing CI scripts and Apps to assist with this soon.
