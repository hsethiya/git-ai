# CI Workflows

Git AI provides a CI workflow integration to automatically preserve authorship information when pull requests are merged. This ensures that AI-assisted code contributions are properly attributed even when commits are squashed or rebased during merge.

## GitHub Actions

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically runs when pull requests are merged, detecting squash and rebase merges and rewriting authorship accordingly.

### Installation

Install the GitHub Actions workflow in your repository:

```bash
git-ai ci github install
```

This creates `.github/workflows/git-ai.yaml` in your repository with the following configuration:

- **Trigger**: Runs on pull request close events
- **Permissions**: Requires `contents: write` to push authorship notes
- **Actions**:
  1. Installs git-ai from the official install script
  2. Configures git user as `github-actions[bot]`
  3. Runs `git-ai ci github run` to process the merge

## Other platforms

If you're using a CI/CD platform other than GitHub Actions, you can use the local CI command to integrate Git AI into your pipeline.

### Usage

```bash
git-ai ci local merge \
  --merge-commit-sha <sha> \
  --base-ref <ref> \
  --head-ref <ref> \
  --head-sha <sha> \
  --base-sha <sha>
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Example |

| `--merge-commit-sha` | SHA of the merge commit created in the base branch | `abc123def456...` |
| `--base-ref` | Name of the base branch (target branch) | `main` or `develop` |
| `--head-ref` | Name of the source branch (PR branch) | `feature/new-login` |
| `--head-sha` | SHA of the last commit in the source branch before merge | `789ghi012jkl...` |
