`git-ai`'s behavior can be configured on developer machines by writing a JSON file in the user's home directory. 

On Linux and macOS, this file is located at `$HOME/.git-ai/config.json`.
On Windows, this file is located at `%USERPROFILE%\.git-ai\config.json`.

## Options 

All the options in `config.json` are optional, and will fall back to default values if not provided. 

| --- | --- | --- |
| `git_path` `Path` | The path to the (unaltered) `git` binary you distribute on developer machines | Defaults to whichever git is on the shell path |
| `ignore_prompts` `boolean` flag | Prompts be excluded from authorship logs | `false` |
| `allow_repositories` `Path[]` | Allow `git-ai` in only these remotes | If not specified or set to an empty list, all repositories are allowed.  |
| `exclude_repositories` `Path[]` | Exclude `git-ai` from these remotes | If a repository is present in both allow and exclude lists, exclusion takes precedence. |

```json
{
    "git_path": "/usr/bin/git",
    "ignore_prompts": false,
    "allow_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai.git"
    ],
    "exclude_repositories": [
        "https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai.git"
    ]
}
```

# Distribution Options

There are two ways to distribute `git-ai` to developer machines: 

- As a Git Wrapper via MDM or an install script (recommended)
- By installing git-ai and configuring core hooks (much more complex, but avoids wrapping git)

## Installing `git-ai` as a Git Wrapper on developer machines

When `git-ai` is installed using the [`install.sh` script](https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai?tab=readme-ov-file#install) (reccomended for personal use) the downloaded binary will be configured to handle calls to both `git` and `git-ai`, effectively creating a wrapper/proxy to `git`. 

If you would like to create a custom installation here is what `git-ai` requires to works correctly cross platform: 

### Directory Structure

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
- Install the `git-ai` binary to: `$HOME/.git-ai/bin/git-ai`
- Create a symlink: `$HOME/.git-ai/bin/git` → `$HOME/.git-ai/bin/git-ai`
- Create a symlink: `$HOME/.git-ai/bin/git-og` → `/path/to/original/git`
- Make the binary executable: `chmod +x $HOME/.git-ai/bin/git-ai`
- On macOS only: Remove quarantine attribute: `xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $HOME/.git-ai/bin/git-ai`

**Windows:**
- Install the binary to: `%USERPROFILE%\.git-ai\bin\git-ai.exe`
- Create a copy: `%USERPROFILE%\.git-ai\bin\git.exe` (copy of `git-ai.exe`)
- Create a batch file: `%USERPROFILE%\.git-ai\bin\git-og.cmd` that calls the original git executable
- Unblock the downloaded files (PowerShell: `Unblock-File`)

### PATH Configuration

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
- Add `$HOME/.git-ai/bin` to the beginning of the user's PATH
- Update the appropriate shell config file (`.zshrc`, `.bashrc`, etc.)

**Windows:**
- Add `%USERPROFILE%\.git-ai\bin` to the System PATH
- The directory should be positioned **before** any existing Git installation directories to ensure the git-ai shim takes precedence

### Configuration File

Create `$HOME/.git-ai/config.json` (or `%USERPROFILE%\.git-ai\config.json` on Windows) with the options outlined at the top of this page. 

### IDE/Agent Hook Installation

After installing the binary and configuring PATH, run:

```bash
git-ai install-hooks
```

This sets up integration with supported IDEs and AI coding agents (Cursor, VS Code with GitHub Copilot, etc.).

### Reference Implementation

Our official install scripts implement all of these requirements and can serve as references:
- Unix/Linux/macOS: [`install.sh`](https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai/blob/main/install.sh)
- Windows: [`install.ps1`](https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai/blob/main/install.ps1)

These scripts handle edge cases like detecting the original git path, preventing recursive installations, and gracefully handling errors. 

## Installing Git AI with `core.hooksPath`

Git version 2.35 (released in 2022) introduced support for configuring git hooks in a central location across all repositories on a machine. 

**Important:** `core.hooksPath` overrides rather than extends repo-specific hooks. Each Git AI hook must be configured to invoke both:
1. The Git AI-specific logic
2. The hooks in the repository's `.git/hooks` folder

The following hooks must be implemented:
- `pre-commit`
- `post-commit`
- `pre-push`
- `post-checkout`
- `post-rewrite`
- `pre-rebase`
- `post-rebase`
- `post-reset`

This approach is more complex than the git wrapper method. We're still working on public documentation for this approach and figuring out the best practices.
