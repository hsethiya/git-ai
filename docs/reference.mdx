When you invoke the Git AI binary as `git` it will proxy the arguments to git and pipe the output and exist code back to you. 

To run Git AI specific commands you invoke the same binary as `git-ai`. The symlinks and $PATH export the install scripts setup sets all this up on your machine. 

```bash
git-ai <command> [options]
```

## User Commands

##### `blame`

Enhanced version of `git blame` that shows AI authorship attribution alongside traditional git blame.

```bash
git-ai blame <file>
```

**Arguments:**
- `<file>` - Path to the file to blame (required)

**Options:**
Mostly API Compatible, supports same options as [`git blame`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame). 


##### `stats`

Show AI authorship statistics for a commit. Displays how much code was written by humans vs AI.

```bash
# Show stats for current HEAD
git-ai stats

# Show stats for specific commit
git-ai stats <commit-sha>

# Output in JSON format
git-ai stats --json
git-ai stats <commit-sha> --json
```

**Options:**
- `<commit-sha>` - Optional commit SHA (defaults to HEAD)
- `--json` - Output statistics in JSON format


##### `install-hooks`

Automatically configure Claude Code, Cursor and GitHub Copilot to send authorship information to the `git-ai` binary 

```bash
git-ai install-hooks
```


## Plumbing Commands (for AI Agents)

These commands are primarily used by AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot) for authorship tracking. End users typically don't need to use these directly.

##### `checkpoint`

Checkpoint working changes and attribute them to an AI agent or human author.

```bash
# Basic checkpoint with preset
git-ai checkpoint <preset>

# Show the current working log
git-ai checkpoint --show-working-log

# Reset the working log
git-ai checkpoint --reset
```

**Presets:**
- `claude` - Claude AI integration
- `cursor` - Cursor editor integration
- `github-copilot` - GitHub Copilot integration
- `mock_ai` - Mock AI for testing

**Options:**
- `--show-working-log` - Display current working log without making changes
- `--reset` - Clear the working log

##### `squash-authorship`

Generate authorship information from squashed commits. Used when commits are squashed to reconstruct authorship metadata.

```bash
git-ai squash-authorship <branch> <new-sha> <old-sha>
git-ai squash-authorship <branch> <new-sha> <old-sha> --dry-run
```

**Arguments:**
- `<branch>` - Branch name (required)
- `<new-sha>` - New commit SHA after squash (required)
- `<old-sha>` - Old commit SHA before squash (required)

**Options:**
- `--dry-run` - Show what would be done without making changes

##### `git-path`

Print the path to the underlying git executable. Used by integrations to locate the git binary.

```bash
git-ai git-path
```

## Version

Show the version of git-ai:

```bash
git-ai version
git-ai --version
git-ai -v
```
