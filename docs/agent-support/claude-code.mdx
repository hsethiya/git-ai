# Using Claude Code with `git-ai`

`git-ai` fully supports both authorship and prompt tracking for Claude Code. To use `git-ai` with Claude Code, run `git-ai install-hooks`.

## How it works

`git-ai` adds hooks to your user-level Claude Code Settings [`~/.claude/settings.json`](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks). These hooks automatically call `git-ai` before and after file edit tool calls to ensure accurate AI authorship tracking.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "command": "git-ai checkpoint claude --hook-input stdin",
            "type": "command"
          }
        ],
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit"
      }
    ],
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "command": "git-ai checkpoint claude --hook-input stdin",
            "type": "command"
          }
        ],
        "matcher": "Write|Edit|MultiEdit"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```
