# Measuring your Agent's AI Authorship with Git AI

Git AI believes that teams will continue to allow their developers to use multiple coding agents, just like they have always allowed developers to choose their own IDE. 

Because of that, one of this [project's core goals](https://github.com/acunniffe/git-ai?tab=readme-ov-file#goals-of-git-ai-project) is to became the vendor agnostic standard for tracking AI code + prompts. 

If you are a developer building a coding agent, you can use Git AI to help your customers track the AI code your tool generates from developer machine through to production.
