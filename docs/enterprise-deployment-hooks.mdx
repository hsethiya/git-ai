An alternative to the git wrapper approach is to deploy Git AI using Git's `core.hooksPath` configuration. This method doesn't require wrapping the git binary but is more complex to set up correctly.

## Overview

Git version 2.35 (released in 2022) introduced support for configuring git hooks in a central location across all repositories on a machine. This allows you to deploy Git AI hooks globally without modifying individual repositories.

**Important:** `core.hooksPath` overrides rather than extends repo-specific hooks. Each Git AI hook must be configured to invoke both:
1. The Git AI-specific logic
2. Any hooks in the repository's `.git/hooks` folder

This ensures that repository-specific hooks (like linters, formatters, or CI triggers) continue to work alongside Git AI.

## Required Hooks

The following hooks must be implemented for Git AI to function correctly:

- `pre-commit`
- `post-commit`
- `pre-push`
- `post-checkout`
- `post-rewrite`
- `pre-rebase`
- `post-rebase`
- `post-reset`

## Get Help with This Deployment Method

This approach is more complex than the git wrapper method. We're still working on public documentation for hook implementation, best practices for hook chaining, and example scripts.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

### Advantages
- No git wrapper required
- Direct git binary execution
- Potentially simpler for some MDM deployments

### Disadvantages
- More complex setup and maintenance
- Must handle hook chaining correctly
- Requires careful coordination with repository hooks
- More difficult to troubleshoot

## Recommended Approach

For most organizations, we recommend the [git wrapper deployment method](/enterprise-deployment-wrapper) as it's simpler, more reliable, and easier to maintain.
